What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer
The spread operator expands an array which allows it to iterate through each index of the array.

The rest operator goes in the argument and allow an unspecified amount of argument to be taken in. It takes these arguments puts them into an array.

# Teacher Feedback

Yup! Just small correction; you mean parameter not argument. The rest operator is used on the parameters to capture all arguments!
